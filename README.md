**Purpose of Analysis:**  
In Part 1, we analyzed the play distributions and tackling efficiency of the four teams that remained in the NFL playoffs: the Baltimore Ravens, Detroit Lions,  Kansas City Chiefs, and San Francisco 49ers. As most know at this point, the 49ers and the Chiefs won their respective games, and are heading to Las Vegas for Super Bowl 58. 

But which team will win the Lombardi Trophy and which one will go home empty-handed? For Part 2, we will delve deep into the two finalists. We'll look into the defenders-in-the-box performance for each team and the importance of tackle factor statistics. We'll then analyze the final score averages (away for the 49ers, home for the Chiefs) to help us understand who has the edge. 


## This project will:

- Evaluate the Chiefs and the 49ers on their ability to make tackles when the defenders are close to the line of scrimmage.
- Analyze the tackle factor performance for defenders to determine its importance.
- Calculate the averages to create a prediction for Super Bowl 58.
